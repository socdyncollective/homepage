# Welcome

<p>
We are a multidisciplinary collective of Data, Computer, and Mathematical sciences researchers across borders that join forces to explore questions related to the dynamics of social systems. 
Our goal is to create a strong community of like minded researchers with a common agenda. 
Currently, our members are located in Amsterdam (University of Amsterdam) and Lisbon (Universidade Nova de Lisboa), and our research ties extend to Princeton (USA), Kessel (Germany), Utrecht (Netherlands), Toulouse (France), Santa Catarina (Brazil), and Santiago (Chile).

Currently, the scope of our activities includes:
- The organization of regular seminars, discussion groups, and workshops
- Joint supervision of MSc and Ph.D. students
- Foster a common research stream
- Fundraising through the EU-level grant applications and support from local and national institutions

Our research spans a broad range of topics including, but not limited, to:
- Developing models to understand the underlying mechanics of Opinion and Innovations Diffusion and Behavioral Adoption
- Use data from social media user activity to test theories and models from social sciences
- The emergence of institutions in social systems, their self-regulatory properties and competitive nature 
- Understand the role of complex networks in the unfolding of diffusion processes, in particular, those of social systems
- The application of Complex Systems to the study of socio-economic phenomena

Recent publications from our core members include that are indicative of our research streams include:
- Vasconcelos, V. V., Dannenberg, A., & Levin, S. A. (2022). Punishment institutions selected and sustained through voting and learning. Nature Sustainability, 1-8.
- Santos, F. P., Lelkes, Y., & Levin, S. A. (2021). Link recommendation algorithms and dynamics of polarization in online social networks. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 118(50), e2102141118.
