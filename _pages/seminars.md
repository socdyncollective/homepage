# Social Dynamics Public Seminars

As part of our activities, we organize regular public seminars.
These seminars are a place for friends, colleagues, and renowned researchers to present and discuss their most recent research with the community interested in studying different aspects of Social Systems Dynamics.

Anyone can attend the seminars online using Zoom. 
If you are interested in attending reach out to us through <a href = "mailto: fpinheiro@novaims.unl.pt,v.v.vasconcelos@uva.nl">e-mail</a> to request the access link.
Please, include information about your name (author name), academic affiliation, and e-mail address.
We will keep it just for our own use.

These seminars are, when possible, conducted in a blended experience with in-person attendance at UvA and Nova IMS.
Check the description of each event to verify the possibility of attending the event in person and the locations where it will be available.

Sessions will not be recorded.
