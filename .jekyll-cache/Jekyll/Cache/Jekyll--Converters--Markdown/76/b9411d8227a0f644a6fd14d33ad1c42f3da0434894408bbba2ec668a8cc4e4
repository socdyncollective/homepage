<p>As part of our activities we organize regular public seminars.
In these seminars we invited friends, colleagues, and renown researchers to present and discuss their most recent research.
Anyone can attend the seminars online, using Zoom. 
If you are interested in attending please reach out to us through <a href="mailto: fpinheiro@novaims.unl.pt,v.v.vasconcelos@uva.nl">e-mail</a>, and inform about your name (author namme), academic affiliation, and e-mail address.

These seminars are, when possible, conducted in a blended experience with in person attendance at UvA and Nova IMS.
Check the description of each event to verify the possibility of attending the event in person and the locations where it will be available.</p>
